## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- TypeScript

### What I learned

Trained to use fetch more often an how to stop browsers from caching api-responses.
Got more used to flexbox and small animations in css. Got more efficient in setting things up (tsc, ...).

### Continued development

I will focus more on asyncronous Typescript/Javascript and Promises, because I seem to have lacks of knowledge there.
